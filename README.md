#YOLO v8 Deep SORT Volleyball Team Detection
This project utilizes YOLO v8 object detection and Deep SORT tracking algorithms to detect and track volleyball teams from China and Korea using the RobFlow dataset.
Requirements include Python 3.x, YOLO v8, Deep SORT, and the RobFlow dataset. After cloning the repository and installing dependencies, users can train the YOLO v8 model on the RobFlow dataset,
then apply it to detect volleyball teams in images or videos. Deep SORT is subsequently used to track the detected teams over time.
For usage examples and detailed instructions, refer to the respective sections in the README file.
